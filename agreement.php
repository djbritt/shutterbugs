Charges

Payment for your Shutterbugs account is due immediately upon completion of the registration process and must be made by the credit or debit card designated by you for Shutterbugs use.

Shutterbugs currently has an automated subscription service. Memberships are for a set length of time and memberships must be renewed in a timely manner or the account will be placed on hold. Emails will be sent to the address on file to warn of an issue with payment and provide instructions for making payment if you decide to continue your Shutterbugs membership. For monthly, 6 month, and 12 month recurring subscriptions, we will automatically bill your credit card for payment.

ALL MEMBERS WITH LIFETIME ACCOUNTS WILL KEEP THEIR LIFETIME STATUS AND NOT BE CHARGED ANYTHING FURTHER FOR THEIR ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE. Lifetime member accounts remain active for as long as the member wishes to use it. After one year of member inactivity, member will be notified at email address on file of possible account cancellation.

If you have an account that requires a monthly fee, charges are to be paid on a monthly basis in the currency in which billed. If payment is not received by Shutterbugs from the issuer of your credit or debit card (or its agent or affiliate), you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Shutterbugs. Each time you use the Services, or allow or cause the Services to be used, you agree and reaffirm that Shutterbugs is authorized to charge your designated card. Your card issuer's agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with Shutterbugs, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You agree that Shutterbugs may (at its option) accumulate charges incurred during your monthly billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each cycle, and that Shutterbugs may delay obtaining authorization from your card issuer until submission of the accumulated charge(s). This means that accumulated charges may appear on the statement you receive from your card issuer.

You agree that Shutterbugs may submit charges for your monthly service fee designated at the time of purchase each month without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (in accordance with Shutterbugs’s verification procedures, as may be established by Shutterbugs from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before Shutterbugs reasonably could act on your notice. If you have any question regarding any charges that have been applied to your account, you must contact Shutterbugs Customer Support within 30 days of the charge date. Failure to use your account will not be deemed a basis for refusing to pay any charges submitted by Shutterbugs in accordance with this Agreement.

You must promptly notify Shutterbugs of changes to: (a) the account number or expiration date of your designated credit or debit card; and (b) your billing address (for the designated credit or debit card). You must also promptly notify Shutterbugs if your card is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft).

Account Fees.  For certain types of Accounts we may charge a fee, such as an Account fee or subscription fee. We may change any fee or charge at any time in our sole discretion. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable. We may offer promotional trial subscriptions to access the Site for free or at special discounted prices. If you sign up for a trial use, your rights to use the Site are limited by the terms of such trial and will terminate or renew according to the terms of your trial arrangement and/or any applicable Additional Terms. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.

(i)  Authorization to Charge for Services.  You must either use a credit card or other payment mechanism accepted by us (e.g., Paypal, iTunes App Store) to activate and maintain a paid Account. You authorize us to charge you through the payment mechanism that you use when registering for an Account. You will also be responsible for charges for any products or services that you order that are offered for sale through the Site. If we do not receive payment from your credit card issuer, or other payment mechanism that you use, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon our demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. Should the credit card or other payment mechanism provided initially be declined for insufficient funds or for any other reason, we reserve the right to charge the credit card or other payment mechanism in installments, at the non-promotional/non-discounted rate in effect at that time, for the duration of the Account subscription you have selected. You will be solely responsible for all overdraft fees and/or penalties that may be assessed by your payment provider.

(ii)  Subscription Renewal.  For paid Accounts we will renew your Account automatically unless you cancel your Account prior to its renewal date. We will charge your credit card (or the other method of payment initially used by you) each year, month or other applicable period (depending on the term that you selected) for the then-current applicable price.

(iii)  Membership Cancellation.  To avoid future billing, if you subscribed to the Site through your desktop or laptop computer you may cancel your Account to the Site prior to its renewal date through the Account Profile Tab of your account Dashboard.  You will continue to have access to your Account for the period of time that has already been prepaid, calculated based on the non-promotional/non-discounted rate in effect at the time of cancellation. There will be no additional billing or charges from the date of cancellation. Please note, we do not provide full or partial refunds for prepaid sums.

Payment

Shutterbugs reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Shutterbugs account without notice upon rejection of any credit or debit card charges or if your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to Shutterbugs when Shutterbugs believes you are liable for the charge. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to Shutterbugs.
