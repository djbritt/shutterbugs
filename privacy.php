Shutterbugs's Children's Privacy Policy:

The Shutterbugs website does not knowingly collect information online from children under the age of 13 without a parent's verifiable consent. Any identifiable child information on the Shutterbugs website is provided by an adult and used only for internal company research purposes. Shutterbugs still makes every effort to comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) rules and regulations by posting a link to this Privacy Policy in the footer of all main website pages.

Shutterbugs provides a safe child user experience on its website. There are no external ads or pop-ups that play when a child is logging in or using the reading programs either online or as mobile apps.

Any in-app purchases in Shutterbugs mobile apps have a Parent Gate installed to minimize the ability of a child to access an app store or purchase or download apps while using the app.

For additional information and tips to keep children safe when online, and for more information about COPPA, we recommend visiting http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/childrens-privacy.
