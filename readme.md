This was a mock site that I made for a class called Web Design at CSUMB. It was a project to help intro students understand how to build a website from the ground up, focusing on the clients desires, good web design skills, and how to focus on people in a website.

This project uses PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the Google Maps API.
